POC of a pdf scraper using syncfusion libraries

Author     : Paul Power

Description: This simple program extracts text and annotations from a pdf and is essentially a POC of using 
             SyncFusion libraries. https://www.syncfusion.com

Notes      : 

              1. Further tests should be done to ensure changes can be written back to the pdf

              2. test that the drawings and graphics can be extracted and written back preserving their integrity 
                  (autocad can import a pdf containing drawings)

              3. syncfusion libraries appear to work ok - files need to be uncompressed first before manipulation???
